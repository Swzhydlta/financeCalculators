# Finance Calculators

This program allows a user to access two different financial calculators, an investment calculator and a home lone repayment calculator.

After running the program, the user will be presented with an options menu where they can choose to calculate an investment or home lone repayment. Based on their choice, the program will then ask them to input a few data points.


## Investment 
If the user chooses 'investment', they will then be prompted to input the investment amount, interest rate, number of years they will invest for, and whether the interest type is simple or compound. The program will then use this data to calculate the total investment.

## Bond
If the user chooses 'bond', they will then be prompted to input the present value of the house, interest rate, and number of months they have to repay the bond. The program will then use this data to calculate the monthly amount they will have to pay to clear the bond by the deadline.
